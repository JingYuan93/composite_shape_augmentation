# composite_shape_augmentation

# Code implementation for : [Data Augmentation-aided fatigue delamination shape prognostics in composites]

# Installation
### Requirements
* Python >= 3.6
* cuda == 10.2
* [Pytorch==1.5.1](https://pytorch.org/)


### Notices:

* prediction file contain a BNN based prognositic model.

# Data Availability
* The original C-scan data are provided in the paper.
* The KL matrices processed from the samples of the four original specimens are provided in the `dataset` folder.
* As for synthetic samples, only the GAN-generated samples under Case 1 are currently available, as a related research is still in progress. If you are interested in collaboration, please contact the first author, Jing Yuan, at yuanjing930418@gmail.com.
